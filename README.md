# Azure-Data-Streams
This is the assigment on data streams for the Big Data Management Systems course.
We are going to use Azure Stream Analytics to process a data stream of ATM transactions and answer stream queries.
The schema of the stream is: (ATMCode, CardNumber, Type, Amount)
1. Create a trial account at: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/
2. Setup an Event Hub.
3. Generate a Security Access Signature: https://github.com/sandrinodimattia/RedDog/releases
4. Edit Generator.html (open with notepad) and update the CONFIG variables with your security access signature.
5. Feed the Event Hub with the use of Generator.html (Open Generator.html in a web browser and press the “Send
Data” button.)
6. Setup a Storage account.
7. Upload the Reference Data files to your storage account (the How-To presentation will be updated to include
reference data material.)
8. Setup a Stream Analytics Job.
9. Use the Event Hub + Reference Data Files as Input.
10. Create a Blob Storage Output.
11. Run the following queries:
- Query 1: Show the total “Amount” of “Type = 0” transactions at “ATM Code = 21” of the last 10 minutes. Repeat as new events keep flowing in (use a sliding window).
- Query 2: Show the total “Amount” of “Type = 1” transactions at “ATM Code = 21” of the last hour. Repeat once every hour (use a tumbling window).
- Query 3: Show the total “Amount” of “Type = 1” transactions at “ATM Code = 21” of the last hour. Repeat once every 30 minutes (use a hopping window).
- Query 4: Show the total “Amount” of “Type = 1” transactions per “ATM Code” of the last one hour (use a sliding window).
- Query 5: Show the total “Amount” of “Type = 1” transactions per “Area Code” of the last hour. Repeat once every hour (use a tumbling window).
- Query 6: Show the total “Amount” per ATM’s “City” and Customer’s “Gender” of the last hour. Repeat once every hour (use a tumbling window).
- Query 7: Alert (SELECT “1”) if a Customer has performed two transactions of “Type = 1” in a window of an hour (use a sliding window).
- Query 8: Alert (SELECT “1”) if the “Area Code” of the ATM of the transaction is not the same as the “Area Code” of the “Card Number” (Customer’s Area Code) - (use a sliding window)
